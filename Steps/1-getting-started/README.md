# Part 1: Getting Started

## Project Setup

Create a new UE4 project from the First Person Shooter template. Delete all vr related input, the "TurnRate" and "LookUpRate". Rename "Turn" to "LookRight". Add FireAxis mapping with left mouse button. Finally, remove motion blur.

If you try in PIE you will notice that you can't turn left or right, this is because we just renamed the "Turn" input.
